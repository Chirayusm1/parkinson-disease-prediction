Abstract:
Parkinson Disease (PD) occurs due to the loss of dopamine in the brains thalamic region that results in involuntary or oscillatory movement in the body. Normally Doctors diagnosis the PD disease clinically with their expertise and experience. But most of the time wrong diagnosis and treatment are reported. For this, patients need to take number of tests for diagnosis, but most of the time, these all tests still not sufficient to diagnosis Parkinson Disease effectively. Parkinson disease (PD) is a universal public health problem of massive measurement. Machine learning method is used to classify between healthy people and people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). 
In this project we have used ‘TensorFlow’ deep learning library of python to implement our neural network for predicting the severity and Machine Learning Models Linear regression, Logistic regression, Decision tree classifier, Support vector machine, Random Forest classifier, Xgboost. The accuracy values obtained by our method are better as compared to the accuracy obtained in previous research.

INTRODUCTION 

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disease where the symptoms gradually develop start with a slight tremor in one hand and a feeling of stiffness in the body and it became worse over time. As the dopamine-generating neurons in parts of the brain become damaged or die, people begin to experience difficulty in speaking, writing, walking, or completing other simple tasks. It affects over 6 million people worldwide. Parkinson's disease symptoms can be different for everyone. Early signs are mild that goes unnoticed. 
 
Symptoms usually begin on one side of your body and gets worsen on that side, afterwards it affects both the sides. Parkinson's symptoms may include o Tremor o Slowed movement o Rigid muscles. o Impaired posture and balance. o Loss of automatic movements o Speech changes o Writing changes 
 
The Parkinson's disease is due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in the brain called dopamine. when there is a decrease in level of the amino acid named dopamine it leads to the abnormal brain activity, which leads to Parkinson’s disease. The cause of Parkinson's disease is still a question mark, but several factors appear to play a role, including: o Genes o Environmental o Triggers 


PROBLEM DEFINITION 
 
Parkinson's disease can't be cured, but medications can help control your symptoms, often dramatically.  So, if it detects in the early stage, the cost of medication will reduce.  
Therefore, our study can be playing an important role for the detecting Parkinson disease with machine learning algorithms. 

There are many research works going on Parkinson Disease (PD) which seemed to be the second most common disease in the world and it still more increasing now every day. This situation leads to build a decision support system for PD. Now ever day’s computational tools have been designed for helping the doctors to make decision about their patients. 
 
Speech pathologists have been trying to get their patients with Parkinson’s disease to raise their voices for years. Although the condition is primarily characterized by tremors and difficulty in walking, most patients also suffer from speech problems, particularly slurring and what’s known in the field as weak voice. While 89% of people with PD experience some type of speech problems. So if the classification percentage of Parkinson disease is high then it’s possible to predict Parkinson in early stage. 
 
Typically, the diagnosis is based on medical summary and neurological examination conducted by interviewing and observing the patient in person using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). It is very difficult to predict PD based on UDPRS in early stages, only 75% of clinical diagnoses of PD are confirmed to be idiopathic PD at autopsy. Thus, automatic techniques based on Artificial Intelligence are needed to increase the diagnosis is accuracy and to help doctors to make better decisions. 

1.1 AIM 
 
 The main aim of this project is to predict if a person has Parkinson ‘s disease or not.  
 
1.2 OBJECTIVES 
 
o	To study different machine learning algorithms.  
o	To evaluate the performance of different machine learning for Parkinson disease prediction. As well as compare the algorithms results.  
o	To show high accuracy that could be achieved using different machine learning and deep learning models to detect Parkinson’s disease at an early stage.

In this project, we have implemented a deep neural network and machine learning models, to predict the presence of Parkinson’s disease. The 3 machine learning models SVM, RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER and XGBOOSTER have achieved 100% accuracy, compared to other existing models. Although we have used a dataset of 197 instances, the accuracy of our approach can be further improved by implementing it on a larger dataset, having a greater number of instances of each class as well as on a combined database of patients’ voice data and other patient features.
