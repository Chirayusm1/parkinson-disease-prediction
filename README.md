Abstract:
Parkinson Disease (PD) occurs due to the loss of dopamine in the brains thalamic region that results in involuntary or oscillatory movement in the body. Normally Doctors diagnosis the PD disease clinically with their expertise and experience. But most of the time wrong diagnosis and treatment are reported. For this, patients need to take number of tests for diagnosis, but most of the time, these all tests still not sufficient to diagnosis Parkinson Disease effectively. Parkinson disease (PD) is a universal public health problem of massive measurement. Machine learning method is used to classify between healthy people and people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). 
In this project we have used ‘TensorFlow’ deep learning library of python to implement our neural network for predicting the severity and Machine Learning Models Linear regression, Logistic regression, Decision tree classifier, Support vector machine, Random Forest classifier, Xgboost. The accuracy values obtained by our method are better as compared to the accuracy obtained in previous research.

PROBLEM DEFINITION 
 
Parkinson's disease can't be cured, but medications can help control your symptoms, often dramatically.  So, if it detects in the early stage, the cost of medication will reduce.  
Therefore, our study can be playing an important role for the detecting Parkinson disease with machine learning algorithms. 

CONCLUSION  

In this project, we have implemented a deep neural network and machine learning models, to predict the presence of Parkinson’s disease. The 3 machine learning models SVM, RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER and XGBOOSTER have achieved 100% accuracy, compared to other existing models. Although we have used a dataset of 197 instances, the accuracy of our approach can be further improved by implementing it on a larger dataset, having a greater number of instances of each class as well as on a combined database of patients’ voice data and other patient features.
